**Group Project Abstract** 

For our group project, we read articles about the digital humanities and made presentations about how authors define, challenge, and utilize the digital humanities as a field of study and interface with traditional humanities scholarship. Technology, big data, and deep learning techniques promise to transform the world we are living in. Working on this group project was valuable because it allowed us to exchange thoughts and critiques of the readings, to write collaboratively, and to create a succinct presentation on the work we did together.   

**Individual Project Abstract**

The code in my Jupyter Notebook does two things. First, it counts the number of unique words in a corpus of Renaissance texts. After counting the single-instance or unique words that occur in this corpus, it then compare their percentages to similar Latin, neo-Latin, and Italian texts in scatterplots and bar charts. It then makes Zipfian regression plots from this data. The charts suggest that a modest corpus of MP texts, while having far more hapax or single-occurance words, are more similar to Latin epic poetry than to Italian romance poetry.
