**Group Project Abstract** 

For our group project, we read a number of articles about the digital humanities and made a presentation that we delivered to the class about how the authors of these texts define, challenge, and utilize the digital humanities as a field of study that interfaces with traditional humanities scholarship. Technology, big data, and deep learning techniques promise to continually transform the world the world that we are living in, as it has already. This is true even for the most traditional fields of study in the humanities. It is no longer a matter of when the digital humanities and the humanities will conincide, now it is more a matter of how well and to what extent. Our presentation distilled some of the key factors that each of these writers share in their negotiations with this emergent reality.  

**Individual Project Abstract**

The code in my Jupyter Notebook does two things. First, it counts the number of unique words in a corpus of Renaissance texts. After counting the single-instance or unique words that occur in this corpus, it then compare their percentages to generically similar Latin, neo-Latin, and Italian texts in scatterplots, bar charts. It then makes Zipfian regression plots from the data. These charts suggest that a modest corpus of MP texts, while having far more hapax or single-occurance words, are more similar to the Latin epic poetry than they are to Italian romance poetry.
